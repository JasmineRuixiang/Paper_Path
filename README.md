This is a repo for important papers that shape my scientific view in computational neuroscience and neuroengineering.


### Population Dynamics
1) _Neural Trajectories in the Supplementary Motor Area and Motor Cortex Exhibit Distinct Geometries, Compatible with Different Classes of Computation_: 
[Russo and Churchland 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627320303664) studied the behavior of supplementary motor area (SMA) under the central hypothesis that SMA computations would internally track motion context (the choice of the cycle task is clever). They used low dimensional projections to illustrate the differences in trajectories of M1 and SMA and analyzed the subspace overlaps the different projections took. Specifically, they brought up the method of neural trajectory divergence and calculated that SMA trajectories had low divergence as expected. It's also inspiring that they used ANN and simulations to corroborate their conclusions. In the end it's enjoyment to read their discussions whether dynamical systems view would be interpreted with any assigned representations.



### Review Papers
1) _Neural Manifolds for the Control of Movement_: [Gallego et al 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28595054/) emphasized 1) the connections between neural connectivity and the constrained and thus low dimensional latent variable manifold; 2) neural modes in motor cortices(1] population variability in PMd is reduced by stimulus presentation, 2] the timeline of studies on the orthogonal potent/null spaces for movement and preparatory activities); 3) learning and connectivity which affect the latent manifold (1] CMU Sadtler & Byron Yu perturbation and learning within/outside of latent space, 2]Sussilo training RNN to represent learning, 3] balanced neural networks also exhibited oscillatory behaviors)
