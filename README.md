This is a repo for important papers that shape my scientific view in computational neuroscience and neuroengineering.


### Population Dynamics
_Neural Trajectories in the Supplementary Motor Area and Motor Cortex Exhibit Distinct Geometries, Compatible with Different Classes of Computation_: 
[Russo and Churchland 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627320303664) studied the behavior of supplementary motor area (SMA) under the central hypothesis that SMA computations would internally track motion context (the choice of the cycle task is clever). They used low dimensional projections to illustrate the differences in trajectories of M1 and SMA and analyzed the subspace overlaps the different projections took. Specifically, they brought up the method of neural trajectory divergence and calculated that SMA trajectories had low divergence as expected. It's also inspiring that they used ANN and simulations to corroborate their conclusions. In the end it's enjoyment to read their discussions whether dynamical systems view would be interpreted with any assigned representations.
